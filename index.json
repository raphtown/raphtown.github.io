A pair of gyroscopes were used to capture rapid rotational changes, as well as measure the absolute rotations through dead reckoning. An accelerometer and magnetometer were used to measure translational changes, as well as combined with the gyroscope rotation estimates through complementary filters to allow for more accurate absolute rotations.\nThe FutureHand was then augmented with a Bluetooth chip, and inserted into a custom molded case, allowing for easy use as a 6-DOF mouse.
