    abstract = {Binding of arrestin to phosphorylated G-protein-coupled
        receptors (GPCRs) controls many aspects of cell signaling. The number
            and arrangement of phosphates may vary substantially for a given
            GPCR, and different phosphorylation patterns trigger different
            arrestin-mediated effects. Here, we determine how GPCR
            phosphorylation influences arrestin behavior by using atomic-level
            simulations and site-directed spectroscopy to reveal the effects of
            phosphorylation patterns on arrestin binding and conformation. We
            find that patterns favoring binding differ from those favoring
            activation-associated conformational change. Both binding and
            conformation depend more on arrangement of phosphates than on their
            total number, with phosphorylation at different positions sometimes
            exerting opposite effects. Phosphorylation patterns selectively
            favor a wide variety of arrestin conformations, differently
            affecting arrestin sites implicated in scaffolding distinct
            signaling proteins. We also reveal molecular mechanisms of these
            phenomena. Our work reveals the structural basis for the
            long-standing "barcode" hypothesis and has important implications
            for design of functionally selective GPCR-targeted drugs.},
